## About The Project
Made with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and used [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/v6.1.4/) to access a spreadsheet via Google Sheets API.

This discord bot provides a fully functional version of my [Guess the Country (Novel)](https://alteredstar.github.io/games/guess_country_novel.html) game where you guess whether a novel was written by a Japanese, Chinese, or Korean author based on its title.

## Featues
### Three Modes
Using `!play` opens the game menu where you can select 1 of 3 modes to begin a game with 1, 5, or 10 rounds.

### Comprehensive Results
Upon finishing the game, you can see which titles you correctly and incorrectly guessed, as well as their correct origin country.
