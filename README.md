## About The Project
Made with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and used [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/v6.1.4/) to access a spreadsheet via Google Sheets API.

This discord bot provides a fully functional version of my [Guess the Country (Novel)](https://alteredstar.github.io/games/guess_country_novel.html) game where you guess whether a novel was written by a Japanese, Chinese, or Korean author based on its title. Also includes my [Guess the Country (Gacha)](https://alteredstar.github.io/games/guess_country_novel.html) version of the game as well as a completely new game: Kyujin or Jiwoo? where you are given an image and guess whetether the person shown is NMIXX's Kyujin or Jiwoo.

## Features
